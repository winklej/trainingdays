You can
create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps or even
release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create
customized workflows that suit your needs.</p> <p>To organize and prioritize your work, we are going to create a project
board at the organizational level. Of course it's possible to create a board on
repository level, but as we will create more repositories during the day and we
want to visualize our work across all repositories, we create a board on
organization level. GitHub provides different templates for a project board.
Today, we use the template <em>Automated Kanban</em>. With this template, we get a
simple board with three columns:</p> <ul><li><strong>To do</strong>, for cards that represent future work</li> <li><strong>In progress</strong>, to display cards we are currently working on</li> <li><strong>Done</strong>, cards we have completed</li></ul> <p>Let us create the project board. Navigate to the <em>Project</em> section of your
organization and create a new project. Name the project <em>AzDC-Day4-Project</em> and
give it a description.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-create-project-part1.df6788aa.png" alt="GitHub create project - step 1"></p> <p>Select the <em>Automated kanban</em> template and choose <em>Private</em> for the visibility
of the project. Link the project to your repository <em>myfirst-repo</em> as well to be
able to show issues and pull requests on the board later.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-create-project-part2.029c7913.png" alt="GitHub create project - step 2"></p> <p>After the project has been created, we can add notes to plan and track our work.
Some example notes are created in the <em>To Do</em> column of the board.
You can delete these notes, as we don't need them. A project board is made up of
issues, pull requests and notes which are displayed as cards. Cards are
categorized in columns of your choice. We can move cards from one column to
another. As we have selected the <em>Automated kanban</em> template, the board is made
up of three columns, but you can add more columns to the board to categorize
cards the way you want.</p> <p>The project is already linked to the repository <em>myfirst-repo</em>. There is a
<em>Menu</em> button at the upper right corner of the board. When you click the button,
you get an overview of activities and a list of linked repositories.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>üìù If the button is not visible, there is the fly-out displayed that allows you
to add cards. Close it and you will see the Menu button.</p></div> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-menu.2c0c99b1.png" alt="GitHub project board menu"></p> <h2 id="assign-permissions-to-a-team"><a href="#assign-permissions-to-a-team" class="header-anchor">#</a> Assign permissions to a team</h2> <p>Only project creators, organization owners and project members can add and manage cards.
We need to assign permissions to a team so they can create and items on the board.
Open the board's menu again. Click the ellipsis <code>...</code> button and open the
<em>Settings</em>.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-menu-ellipses.d2444433.png" alt="GitHub board menu ellipses"></p> <p>In the <em>Options</em> section you can manage the visibility of the project and
organization member's permissions. <em>Write</em> is the default baseline permission
level for all members of the organization.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>üìù To restrict access to all organization members, set Read as baseline permission level.</p></div> <p>Since we are working with a single team in our organization today and we may
have already added <em>Outside collaborators</em> to this team, we still need to give
<em>Write</em> permissions to this team. Navigate to the <em>Teams</em> section and assign
<em>Write</em> permissions to the <em>AzDC-Team</em> team.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-team-perm.24c1438d.png" alt="GitHub board team permissions"></p> <h2 id="add-project-administrators"><a href="#add-project-administrators" class="header-anchor">#</a> Add project Administrators</h2> <p>As the organization owner and project creator, only you have full administrative
rights in this project. We can make both members of the organization, but also
<em>Outside collaborators</em> project administrators. In the <em>Collaborators</em> section
you can add collaborators and give them <em>Admin</em> permissions.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-collaborators.ace1de14.png" alt="GitHub board collaborators"></p> <h2 id="working-with-cards"><a href="#working-with-cards" class="header-anchor">#</a> Working with cards</h2> <p>If we want to plan and prioritize our work, we can work with notes in the board.
You can add notes to serve as task reminders or to add information related to
the project you are working on.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>üìù You can format your notes using Markdown syntax.</p></div> <p>Let's create a note and take a closer look at how to convert the note into an
issue when you start working.</p> <p>Click the <em>+</em> button in the <em>To do</em> column to add a note and set the following
text:</p> <div class="language-Text extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>#### Convert note to issue.

A sample note to see how a note is converted to an issue.
</code></pre></div><p>Now let's create another note to take a closer look at how we can reference an
issue. Add the node and set the following text:</p> <div class="language-Text extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>#### Reference an issue

A sample note to see how a note can reference an issue.
</code></pre></div><p>You can drag and drop to reorder notes and move them between columns.</p> <p>Now let us convert the first note <em>Convert note to issue</em> to an issue to assign
it to a repository.</p> <p>Click the ellipsis <em>...</em> button on the <em>Convert to issue</em> card and click
<em>Convert to issue</em>.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-note-to-issue.a42a58ae.png" alt="GitHub note to issue"></p> <p>Choose the <em>myfirst-repo</em> repository and convert the note to an issue.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-note-to-issue-convert.f12ba339.png" alt="GitHub note to issue convert"></p> <p>After the converting the note, open the issue detail and have a look at the
additional option we have, to specify more information about the issue. Make
yourself the assignee of the issue and set the label <em>good first issue</em>.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-issue-details.f889d454.png" alt="GitHub issue details"></p> <p>Your board should now look like this:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-overview-01.a71b63ec.png" alt="GitHub board overview-01"></p> <p>Now you may wonder why you convert a note into an issue. In an issue we can
additionally specify more detailed information. We can specify who is
responsible for the issue, which repository it refers to and we can assign
labels to classify the issue. With this approach, we could map the following
workflow:</p> <p>We use notes to plan and prioritize the work for our next milestone (sprint).
When we start working on the task, we convert the note into an issue, choose a
repository, assign a responsible person, classify it and push it to the <em>In
progress</em> column.</p> <p>This is a very simple but agile process flow. But maybe this flow is not
sufficient, especially if notes do not always refer to only one repository, but
are spread over several repositories. Notes can be used to summarize issues in
different repositories. If we work according to agile methods, we can e.g. store
a <em>UserStory</em> as a note in our board and create tasks in different repositories
as an issue. Or we can go one level higher and use Notes to map <em>Features</em> and
Issues to map <em>UserStories</em> in a repository. Ultimately, there are many ways to
map an agile process with GitHub project boards. There is no one-size-fits-all
solution.</p> <p>Finally, let's look at how we can reference Issues in a note. Navigate to your
<em>myfirst-repo</em> repository and go to the <em>Issues</em> section. You see that there is
already an issue listed. It's the issue that we created earlier. Now, add a new
Issue name it <em>Referenced Issue</em>, set the label <em>good first issue</em>, assign
yourself and submit the new issue. Copy the issue's URL from the browser's
address bar and go back to your project board. Edit the note <em>Reference an
issue</em> and paste the issue's URL.</p> <p>Your board should now look like this:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-overview-02.a889b073.png" alt="GitHub board overview-02"></p> <h2 id="plan-milestones-sprints"><a href="#plan-milestones-sprints" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plan milestones (sprints)</h2> <p>You can use milestones to group and track on groups of issues and pull requests
in a repository. Unfortunately you can not define milestones at organization
level. Therefore it's not possible to set a uniform rhythm for all projects
within an organization. Instead you have to define milestones in each repository
and keep them in sync.</p> <p>Milestones would be an excellent way to plan a Sprint. But as mentioned,
milestones cannot be created on an organizational level. We need to find another
way to assign tasks to a Sprint. For example, we could work with labels and
create a label for each Sprint. We can then assign these Sprint labels to issues
and pull requests.</p> <p>Another option would be to create a new project for each sprint and put the
sprint name at the end of the project name.</p> <p>If you want to take a closer look at Milestones, check out the GitHub
documentation

You
can apply labels in the repository the label was created in. As with Milestones
it is not possible to manage labels at organization level, but you can manage
default labels which are automatically added to a repository when the repository
is created.</p> <p>Now we want to add two new default labels which will be added to each new
repository. Navigate to your organization's settings, go to <em>Repository
defaults</em> and add the following labels:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Name</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Color</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>azdc-challenge</td> <td>An AzDC-Challenge</td> <td><em>your choice</em></td></tr> <tr><td>azdc-breakout</td> <td>An AzDC-Breakout session</td> <td><em>your choice</em></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>We have to add these labels to the <em>myfirst-repo</em> manually,
because there is no syncing in the background to add these labels to already
created repositories. Navigate to <em>myfirst-repo</em>, go to <em>Issues</em> and
add these labels.</p> <p>Now go back to your project board and assign the <em>azdc-challenge</em> label to both
issues we created earlier.</p> <p>Your board should look like this:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-overview-03.0ba2bfa6.png" alt="HitHub board overview-03"></p> <p>In the last part of this challenge we will describe how to plan the rest of the
work for today. We will add a note now for the <em>Breakout Session</em> where we
will deploy the Azure Developer College's sample application to Azure with
GitHub Actions workflows. Add the note with the following text:</p> <div class="language-Text extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>#### Deploy the sample application

Use GitHub Actions workflows to deploy the sample application to your Azure
subscription.
</code></pre></div><p>Labels help us to classify our issues. We can filter the board by labels etc. to
get a reduced view on our project. Click on the <code>filters/search</code> box in the board
to get an overview of how filtering works in GitHub. Try to filter by the label
<em>azdc-challenge</em>.</p> <h2 id="see-how-issues-and-pull-requests-flow-automatically-through-the-different-board-s-columns"><a href="#see-how-issues-and-pull-requests-flow-automatically-through-the-different-board-s-columns" class="header-anchor">#</a> See how issues and pull requests flow automatically through the different board's columns</h2> <p>In the previous section we have seen how we can use a project board to plan our
work. Now it's time to see how an issue and a pull request automatically flow
through the different board's column to track progress. We add a new
<em>Note</em>, convert it to an issue and edit the <em>README.md</em> file within a feature
branch. We commit and push changes to the feature branch and create a pull
request to merge these changes to the <em>main</em> branch.</p> <p>First, go to your project board and add a <em>Note</em> with the following text:</p> <div class="language-text extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>Issue and Pull Request

Change README.md in a feature branch, commit and push changes and merge these
changes to the _main_ branch with a pull request
</code></pre></div><p>Next, convert the <em>Note</em> to an issue, link it to the repository <em>myfirst-repo</em>,
assign yourself and set the label <em>azdc-challenge</em>.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>üìù Note down the issue's id, because we need it later to reference it in the
pull request. You can find the id after the '#' character.</p></div> <p>Your board should look like this:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-overview-04.3907ac33.png" alt="GitHub board overview"></p> <p>Now, drag and drop the issue to the <em>In progress</em> column to show project members
that you are working on that topic.</p> <p>Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you have cloned the repository.
Use the <em>git branch</em> and <em>git checkout</em> commands to create a new branch and
check it out:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code><span class="token function">git</span> branch issueprdemo
<span class="token function">git</span> checkout issueprdemo

or

<span class="token function">git</span> checkout <span class="token parameter variable">-b</span> issueprdemo
</code></pre></div><p>Change the text in the <em>README.md</em> file and commit and push your changes:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>git add .
git commit -m &quot;Changed text&quot;
git push --set-upstream origin issueprdemo
</code></pre></div><p>In your browser, navigate to the repository <em>myfirst-repo</em> and go to the section
<em>Pull requests</em>. You will see that GitHub informs us that there are recent
pushes to the branch <em>issueprdemo</em> available. Click <em>Compare &amp; pull request</em>.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-compare-and-pr.48e2df93.png" alt="GitHub compare and pull request"></p> <p>In the <em>Open a pull request</em> view, set the label <em>azdc-challenge</em> and the
project <em>AzDC-Day4-Project</em> to link the pull request to the project. In the pull
request's body we use the keyword <em>close</em> and the character <em>#</em> to link the pull
request to our issue (please use your issue's id) and to inform GitHub that this
issue is closed when the pull request is merged into the <em>main</em> branch.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-open-pr.4894bd64.png" alt="GitHub open pull request"></p> <p>Navigate back to your project board. You will see that there is a new card with
the pull request symbol displayed. Why is the pull request displayed on the
board?</p> <p>When we created the board we used the template <em>Automated kanban</em> which comes
with predefined automation rules. These rules allows us to display issues and
pull requests on the board, as long as they are linked to our project. Both are
displayed depending on their status in the columns of the board. You can find
the rules by clicking at the <em>Manage</em> link in each column. Take your time and
checkout the rules for each column.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-automation-rules.847c02d2.png" alt="GitHub"></p> <p>Now let's look at how both cards automatically move from the <em>In progress</em>
column to the <em>Done</em> column when we complete our pull request. To do this, we
navigate to the open pull request and merge it into the <em>main</em> branch.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-merge-pr.f93445d1.png" alt="GitHub merge pull request"></p> <p>After the pull request is merged, we see that both cards were moved to the
<em>Done</em> column.</p> <h2 id="plan-your-work-for-day4"><a href="#plan-your-work-for-day4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plan your work for day4</h2> <p>As the day goes on, we will keep reflecting our work on the board in the
challenges that are still to come. In the respective challenges it's pointed out
to create <em>Notes</em> or <em>Issues</em> and to link them to our project.</p> <h2 id="summary-and-outlook"><a href="#summary-and-outlook" class="header-anchor">#</a> Summary and outlook</h2> <p>We have seen how to plan and track our work with GitHub project boards. There
are many ways to map an agile process, but certainly no one-size-fits-all
solution. Projects can be created and managed at the organizational or
repository level. Labels, milestones and issues are always
assigned to a repository, which makes the handling of a project at the
organizational level somewhat difficult, especially if you want to manage a
project across multiple repositories.</p> <p>GitHub is working on the next generation of Project planning and it will be
exciting to see how more complex planning scenarios can be managed with it. If
you are interested, why don't you sign up for the beta? <a href="https://github.com/features/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Issues -
